## Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer.

This is a part of my ongoing study and practice of data structures and algorithms.
Most of my implementations will be written in C and Python in order to cover both high- and low-level concepts.
